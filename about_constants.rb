  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?

  # This depends on scope and how things are defined.
  # For example, the above class, Bird < Animal, is within the scope of the class MyAnimals which redefines the constant LEGS.
  # So the class Bird has LEGS redefined in its scope. the class MyAnimals::Oyster uses LEGS as defined in Animal despite the 
  # constant being re-defined in MyAnimals. This is because of where ruby searches for variables and scope. The LEGS = 2 
  # as defined in class MyAnimals is out of scope of the Oyster class because Oyster is a subclass of Animal and not 
  # MyAnimals, despite its name.
